MATLAB + xPCtarget based realtime detection of sound and playback 

This software is a collection of MATLAB codes for realtime detection 
of a target pattern in animal vocalization (like songbird's song) 
and generation of pre-designed outputs. 

To run this program, it requires two PCs, master and slave. 
Slave PC is installed DA/AD board (we use National Instrments's 
PCI-6251 or PCI-6052) and run in realtime. 
Master PC communicates with slave PC through TCP/IP connection 
and control the program, save data in sound event driven manner. 

All the code is written in MATLAB using xPCtarget toolbox, by Kosuke Hamaguchi.

Sound feature calculation is based on Segal Saar's matlab code.

Detection of target sound chunk is done by Support Vector Machine (libsvm).
